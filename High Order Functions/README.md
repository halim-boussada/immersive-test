## High-Order-Functions

**cohort3** students went to Disney land Tokyo
using the high order functions you know (each, filter, map, and reduce)
write functions that answer the following questions that were asked to them:

- [ ] who's the tallest person in the group?
- [ ] who's old enough to get in the ride (10y min)?
- [ ] what are the names of everyone in the group?
- [ ] what's the total of their hights?

### _P.S_ ⚠️⚠️⚠️ : you can only use each of the high order functions once for each function and once in that function !!

```javascript
var cohort3 = [
  {
    name: "Charaf",
    age: 10,
    heightInInches: 52,
  },
  {
    name: "Ranwa",
    age: 9,
    heightInInches: 45,
  },
  {
    name: "Ali",
    age: 10,
    heightInInches: 55,
  },
  {
    name: "el Hou",
    age: 11,
    heightInInches: 48,
  },
];
```
